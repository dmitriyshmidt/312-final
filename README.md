# Minecraft Server on AWS with Terraform and Bash

## Overview
This project provisions and configures a Minecraft server on AWS using Terraform and a Bash script. The goal is to demonstrate infrastructure as code (IaC), automation, and service management. This should all be done without manual steps taken or AWS console usage by a user. This is my final project for CS-312.
